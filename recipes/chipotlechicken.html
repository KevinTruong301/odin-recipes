        <p><h1>Chipotle Chicken</h1></p>
        <p><h4>Ingredients</h4></p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 ounce dried chipotle chile pepper</li>
                <li>1 ounce dried ancho chile pepper</li>
                <li>½ cup water</li>
                <li>½ red onion, cut into small chunks</li>
                <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons sea salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>2 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><h4>Directions</h4></p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Place chipotle and ancho chile peppers in a shallow bowl; pour in water. Cover the bowl and let sit at room temperature until peppers are softened, 10 to 12 hours. Drain water and remove seeds from peppers.</li>
                <li> chile peppers, red onion, garlic, sea salt, cumin, oregano, and black pepper in a blender until a coarse paste forms; add olive oil and blend until marinade is smooth.</li>
                <li> chicken thighs between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a 1/2-inch thickness.</li>
                <li>Place chicken in a resealable plastic bag and add marinade. Turn chicken several times to coat. Seal bag and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours.</li>
                <li>Preheat an indoor grill with top and bottom plates for medium-high heat.</li>
                <li> chicken from the bag and discard marinade.</li>
                <li> chicken on the preheated grill, close the lid, and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 7 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Cut chicken into strips and serve warm.</li>
            </ol>
